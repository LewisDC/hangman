# Hangman

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts. This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

## Milestone 1: Set up the environment

In this project, we'll use GitHub to track changes to our code and save them online in a GitHub repo called hangman

## Milestone 2: Create the variables for the game

* Created a local version of the repo with *git clone*
* Created a file named **milestone_2.py** which will contrain the code for this milestone.
* Created a list of words, in this case 5 fruits and assigned the list to a variable called 'word_list'.
* Imported the random module.
* Used the random.choice method to assign a random word from 'word_list' to the variable word.
* Used the 'input()' method to request a letter from the user and assign it to the variable 'guess'
* Created an if statement that checks if the length of the input is equal to 1 and is alphabetical:
